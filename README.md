Interactive history of Occitania/south France and north Spain
========

Interactive history of Occitania/south France and north Spain using D3.

The goal is to use the web to convey the history and cultures of the various regions of Occitania.  
Occitania and Catalonia are regions in southern France and northern Spain. History has put them in different countries, yet for centuries they shared similar languages.  
The languages in these areas are *not* dialects of either French or Spanish.  
Catalan and Occitan are categorized as Occitano-Romance languages.  

Stage 1 is to create a map that lets you see each region with cities in detail.
