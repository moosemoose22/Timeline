Roadmap for the future
------

##### Bugs
1. Some of the level 3 administrative regions in Spain have names such as "n.a.(*counter*)." You can run [updateESPmissingAdm3/findAdm3.js](updateESPmissingAdm3/findAdm3.js) to see them. In the demo, you can see them by opening a region and hovering over a subregion that has such a name.  
2. Most of the level 3 administrative names were attained by grabbing the level 3 adminstrative data from cities within each subregion. This algorithm may have been off at times. Note that the Palencia region has 2 subregions (administrative level 3) that are called Valdivia. One of those is likely incorrect.

##### Future plans
1. Possibly have text about each region within the shape of each region.  
2. Design a way to show more informatino abuot each region.  
3. Show the population of a city and its name when you hover over it.
